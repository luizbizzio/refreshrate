## How It Works 🧪

### Ghost Count Metric 👻

One of the standout features of **RefreshRate.app** is the **Ghost Count**. This visual tool helps you understand your monitor's performance in a fun and intuitive way.

- **Ghost Images:** As a moving ball traverses the screen, it leaves behind semi-transparent "ghost" images.
  
- **🔄 Relation to Refresh Rate (Hz):**
  - **Higher Refresh Rates (e.g., 144Hz):** More ghost images appear, indicating smoother and more fluid motion.
  - **Lower Refresh Rates (e.g., 60Hz):** Fewer ghost images suggest less smooth motion, which might result in motion blur or stutter.

- **🎮 Relation to Frames Per Second (FPS):**
  - **Higher FPS:** More frames are rendered each second, leading to more ghost images and a more responsive display.
  - **Lower FPS:** Fewer frames per second result in fewer ghost images, which can indicate potential performance issues.

- **⏱️ Relation to Frame Duration (ms):**
  - **Shorter Frame Duration:** Means frames are rendered more quickly, resulting in more ghost images and smoother motion.
  - **Longer Frame Duration:** Indicates slower frame rendering, leading to fewer ghost images and potentially choppy motion.

By observing the number of ghost images, you can easily gauge the interplay between your monitor's refresh rate, FPS, and frame duration. This helps you make informed decisions to optimize your display settings for the best visual experience.
