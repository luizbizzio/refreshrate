## 🧪 How It Works

### 👻 Ghost Count Magic

Ever wondered how smooth your screen feels? **Refresh Rate App** uses our **Ghost Count** feature to show you in a fun and visual way! Here’s how it works:

- **👻 Ghost Images:** Imagine a ball moving across your screen, leaving behind faint, transparent copies of itself. These are the "ghost" images!

- **🔄 Refresh Rate (Hz):**
  - **Higher Refresh Rates (e.g., 144Hz):** Your screen updates 144 times every second! More updates mean the ball moves smoothly, leaving lots of ghost images.
  - **Lower Refresh Rates (e.g., 60Hz):** Your screen updates 60 times every second. Fewer updates mean fewer ghost images.

- **🎮 Frames Per Second (FPS):**
  - **Higher FPS:** The app renders more frames each second, creating more ghost images for fluid motion.
  - **Lower FPS:** Fewer frames per second result in fewer ghost images, making motion look choppy.

### 🧠 The Science Behind the Fun

Let’s break it down with some simple math and examples!

1. **Understanding Refresh Rate (Hz):**
   - **Definition:** How many times your screen updates every second.
   - **Example for 60Hz:**
     - **Total Time in a Second:** 1000 milliseconds (ms).
     - **Time per Refresh:** 1000ms / 60Hz ≈ **16.67ms** per refresh.

2. **Frames Per Second (FPS):**
   - **Definition:** How many frames the app renders each second.
   - **Example for 60FPS:**
     - **Frame Duration:** 1000ms / 60FPS ≈ **16.67ms** per frame.

3. **Traversal Time Options:**
   - **Traversal Time:** How quickly the ball moves across the screen.
   - **Options:** 50ms, 100ms, 250ms, 500ms, and 1000ms.

### 🎯 Dynamic Ghost Count Options

**Refresh Rate App** lets you choose how fast the ball crosses the screen. Here's what happens:

- **🔹 Example on a 60Hz Screen with 60FPS:**
  - **1000ms Traversal Time:**
    - **Calculation:** 1000ms / 16.67ms per frame ≈ **60 ghosts**
    - **What It Means:** The ball takes 1 second to cross, leaving 60 ghost images—one for each frame.
  - **50ms Traversal Time:**
    - **Calculation:** 50ms / 16.67ms per frame ≈ **3 ghosts**
    - **What It Means:** The ball crosses the screen in 50ms, leaving only 3 ghost images for a snappier motion.

- **🔹 Example on a 90Hz Screen with 90FPS:**
  - **1000ms Traversal Time:**
    - **Calculation:** 1000ms / 11.11ms per frame ≈ **90 ghosts**
    - **What It Means:** The ball takes 1 second to cross, leaving 90 ghost images.
  - **50ms Traversal Time:**
    - **Calculation:** 50ms / 11.11ms per frame ≈ **5 ghosts**
    - **What It Means:** The ball crosses the screen in 50ms, leaving 5 ghost images.

### 🧮 Quick Example Scenarios

| **Traversal Time** | **Monitor Refresh Rate (Hz)** | **FPS** | **Number of Ghosts** | **Time Represented** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 50ms               | 60Hz                          | 60FPS   | 3                     | 50ms                  |
| 1000ms             | 60Hz                          | 60FPS   | 60                    | 1000ms (1 second)     |
| 50ms               | 90Hz                          | 90FPS   | 5                     | 50ms                  |
| 1000ms             | 90Hz                          | 90FPS   | 90                    | 1000ms (1 second)     |

### 💡 Takeaway

- **More Ghosts = Smoother Motion:** Higher refresh rates and FPS create more ghost images, making motion appear fluid.
- **Fewer Ghosts = Snappier Motion:** Faster traversal times with fewer ghosts make animations look quicker and more responsive.

By adjusting the traversal time, you can see how your monitor's refresh rate and the app's FPS work together to create different visual experiences. It’s like having a little ghost tracker showing you exactly how smooth your display is!
